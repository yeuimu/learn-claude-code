# v8: Team Messaging

**Core insight: Subagents are dispatched workers. Teammates are colleagues sitting next to you.**

v3 subagents are "divide and conquer": the main agent dispatches a task, the subagent executes, returns a result, and is destroyed. For tasks like "develop frontend and backend simultaneously," subagents are not enough: they cannot communicate with each other, cannot share progress, and are destroyed after execution.

## Five Conceptual Layers

```sh
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Layer 5: Team Lifecycle                                      |
|    TeamCreate -> spawn teammates -> TeamDelete                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Layer 4: Message Protocol                                    |
|    message | broadcast | shutdown_request |                    |
|    shutdown_response | plan_approval_response                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Layer 3: Inbox System                                        |
|    .teams/{team}/{name}_inbox.jsonl                            |
|    Atomic lock files, read-and-clear pattern                   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Layer 2: Teammate Execution                                  |
|    Daemon thread per teammate, own agent loop                  |
|    TEAMMATE_TOOLS = BASE_TOOLS + task CRUD + SendMessage       |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Layer 1: Shared State                                        |
|    Tasks (v6) on disk, Background (v7) notifications           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Subagent vs Teammate

| Feature | Subagent (v3) | Teammate (v8) |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Lifecycle | One-shot | Persistent (spawned, works, shuts down) |
| Communication | Return value (one-way) | Message protocol (two-way) |
| Parallelism | Pseudo-parallel (blocks on return) | True parallel (independent threads) |
| Task management | None | Shared Tasks (v6) |
| Use case | One-off tasks | Multi-module long-term collaboration |

## Section A: Team Infrastructure

### Architecture

```sh
Team Lead (main agent)
  |-- Teammate: frontend   (daemon thread)
  |-- Teammate: backend    (daemon thread)
  +-- Shared:
        |-- .tasks/         <- everyone sees the same board
        +-- .teams/         <- JSONL inbox files per teammate
```

Each Teammate runs as a daemon thread with its own agent loop, its own context window, and runs compression (v5) independently.

### TeammateManager

```python
class TeammateManager:
    MESSAGE_TYPES = {
        "message", "broadcast", "shutdown_request",
        "shutdown_response", "plan_approval_response",
    }

    def __init__(self):
        self._teams: dict[str, dict[str, Teammate]] = {}
        self._lock = threading.Lock()
```

Three operations form the team lifecycle:
1. `create_team(name)` -- register a new team, create its directory
2. `spawn_teammate(name, team_name, prompt)` -- start a teammate thread
3. `delete_team(name)` -- send shutdown to all members, remove team

### Teammate Data Model

```python
@dataclass
class Teammate:
    name: str
    team_name: str
    agent_id: str = ""       # Format: "name@team_name"
    status: str = "active"   # active | shutdown
    thread: threading.Thread
    inbox_path: Path         # .teams/{team_name}/{name}_inbox.jsonl
    color: str = ""          # ANSI color for terminal output
```

The `agent_id` uses `name@team_name` (e.g. `backend@rest-to-graphql`) for identification.

### Team Directory Structure

```sh
.teams/
  rest-to-graphql/
    config.json             <- team metadata and member list
    frontend_inbox.jsonl    <- frontend teammate's inbox
    frontend_inbox.lock     <- lock file for atomic writes
    backend_inbox.jsonl     <- backend teammate's inbox
    backend_inbox.lock
```

---

## Section B: Message Protocol

### Message Types

| Type | Scenario | Direction |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `message` | "API docs are at docs/api.md" | Point-to-point |
| `broadcast` | "Database schema changed, everyone take note" | One-to-many |
| `shutdown_request` | "Project done, please wrap up" | Lead -> Teammate |
| `shutdown_response` | "I have wrapped up" | Teammate -> Lead |
| `plan_approval_response` | "Your refactoring plan is approved" | Lead -> Teammate |

Messages are delivered as `<teammate-message>` XML when injected into the teammate's conversation:

```xml
<teammate-message teammate_id="{sender}" summary="{summary}">
{message text}
</teammate-message>
```

### Inbox Architecture

```sh
Team Lead                                  config.json
+-----------+                              +-----------+
| SendMsg() |                              | team:     |
+-----+-----+                              |  members  |
      |                                    |  config   |
      v                                    +-----------+
+------------------+
| TeammateManager  |
| .send_message()  |    point-to-point        inbox lock
|                  +----> /team/A_inbox.jsonl  (atomic writes)
| .send_message()  |
| type=broadcast   +----> /team/B_inbox.jsonl
|                  +----> /team/C_inbox.jsonl
+------------------+
                          ^
                          |
+-----------+    check_inbox() drains
| Teammate  | <-----------+
| A_inbox   |
+-----------+
```

### JSONL Inbox File Format

Each teammate has a dedicated inbox file at `.teams/{team_name}/{name}_inbox.jsonl`:

```json
{"type": "message", "sender": "lead", "content": "Please finish the login page first", "timestamp": 1709234567.89}
{"type": "broadcast", "sender": "backend", "content": "API schema is finalized", "timestamp": 1709234590.12}
```

Reading the inbox consumes all messages and clears the file (read-and-clear pattern).

### Inbox Lock Files

Concurrent writes are protected by lock files using `os.O_CREAT | os.O_EXCL` for atomic acquisition:

```python
def _write_to_inbox(inbox_path, message):
    lock_path = inbox_path.with_suffix(".lock")
    for _ in range(50):   # retry up to 50 times
        try:
            fd = os.open(str(lock_path), os.O_CREAT | os.O_EXCL | os.O_WRONLY)
            os.close(fd)
            break
        except FileExistsError:
            time.sleep(0.05)
    try:
        with open(inbox_path, "a") as f:
            f.write(json.dumps(message) + "\n")
    finally:
        lock_path.unlink(missing_ok=True)
```

Both `_write_to_inbox` and `check_inbox` use this lock file pattern to prevent race conditions between concurrent reads and writes.

## Section C: Teammate Loop

### TEAMMATE_TOOLS vs ALL_TOOLS

| Tool | Team Lead | Teammate |
|------|-----------|----------|
| bash, read_file, write_file, edit_file | Yes | Yes |
| TaskCreate, TaskGet, TaskUpdate, TaskList | Yes | Yes |
| SendMessage | Yes | Yes |
| Task (spawn subagents/teammates) | Yes | No |
| Skill | Yes | No |
| TaskOutput, TaskStop | Yes | No |
| TeamCreate, TeamDelete | Yes | No |

Teammates get 9 tools (4 BASE + 4 task CRUD + SendMessage) -- enough to do work and communicate, but not enough to spawn agents or manage the team.

### Task Tool: Three Modes

The same Task tool now has three modes:
1. No extra params -- synchronous subagent (v3)
2. `run_in_background=True` -- background subagent (v7)
3. `team_name + name` -- persistent teammate (v8)

### Teammate Work Loop

In v8, the teammate loop is straightforward: receive a prompt, work until done, then shut down. No idle cycle or auto-claiming -- those are v9. The inbox is polled at 1-second intervals (matching cli.js cZz=1000ms).

```python
def _teammate_loop(self, teammate, initial_prompt):
    sub_system = f"You are teammate '{teammate.name}' in team '{teammate.team_name}'..."
    sub_messages = [{"role": "user", "content": initial_prompt}]

    while teammate.status != "shutdown":
        # Compression before each API call
        sub_messages = CTX.microcompact(sub_messages)
        if CTX.should_compact(sub_messages):
            sub_messages = CTX.auto_compact(sub_messages)

        response = client.messages.create(
            model=MODEL, system=sub_system,
            messages=sub_messages, tools=TEAMMATE_TOOLS, max_tokens=8000,
        )

        if response.stop_reason == "tool_use":
            results = [execute(tc) for tc in tool_calls]
            sub_messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.content})
            sub_messages.append({"role": "user", "content": results})
            continue

        # No more tool calls -- check inbox for new instructions
        new_messages = self.check_inbox(teammate.name, teammate.team_name)
        if new_messages:
            if any(m.get("type") == "shutdown_request" for m in new_messages):
                return  # Exit
            sub_messages.append({"role": "user", "content": format(new_messages)})
            continue

        # Nothing left to do
        return
```

## Section D: Full Lifecycle

### End-to-End Walkthrough

```sh
1. TeamCreate("rest-to-graphql")
   -> .teams/rest-to-graphql/ created
   -> config.json initialized

2. Task(prompt="Handle frontend", team_name="rest-to-graphql", name="frontend")
   -> Teammate spawned as daemon thread
   -> frontend_inbox.jsonl created

3. Task(prompt="Handle backend", team_name="rest-to-graphql", name="backend")
   -> Second teammate spawned

4. SendMessage(recipient="frontend", content="Use the new API schema")
   -> Message written to frontend_inbox.jsonl (with lock)

5. Frontend teammate's loop:
   -> check_inbox() reads and clears inbox (with lock)
   -> Message injected as <teammate-message> XML
   -> Teammate processes and continues working

6. SendMessage(type="broadcast", content="Schema finalized")
   -> Written to ALL teammate inboxes

7. TeamDelete("rest-to-graphql")
   -> shutdown_request sent to all teammates
   -> Each teammate exits on next inbox check
   -> Team removed from registry
```

### Shutdown Protocol

1. Team Lead sends `shutdown_request` via `SendMessage`
2. Message written to the teammate's JSONL inbox
3. Teammate reads `shutdown_request` on next inbox check
4. Teammate exits its loop
5. `TeamDelete` sends shutdown to all teammates, then removes the team

## The Deeper Insight

> **From command to collaboration.**

v3 subagents follow a command pattern: the main agent gives orders, subagents obey. v8 Teammates follow a collaboration pattern: the Team Lead sets direction, Teammates work on shared tasks, communicate through inboxes.

```sh
Subagent  -> do one thing, report back            (intern)
Teammate  -> work on assigned task, communicate   (colleague)
Team Lead -> create team, assign work, coordinate (manager)
```

**One agent has limits. A team of agents has reach.**
