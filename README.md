                    THE AGENT PATTERN
                    =================

    User --> messages[] --> LLM --> response
                                      |
                            stop_reason == "tool_use"?
                           /                          \
                         yes                           no
                          |                             |
                    execute tools                    return text
                    append results
                    loop back -----------------> messages[]


    That's the minimal loop. Every AI coding agent needs this loop.
    Production agents add policy, permissions, and lifecycle layers.
```

**12 progressive sessions, from a simple loop to isolated autonomous execution.**
**Each session adds one mechanism. Each mechanism has one motto.**

> **s01** &nbsp; *"One loop & Bash is all you need"* &mdash; one tool + one loop = an agent
>
> **s02** &nbsp; *"Adding a tool means adding one handler"* &mdash; the loop stays the same; new tools register into the dispatch map
>
> **s03** &nbsp; *"An agent without a plan drifts"* &mdash; list the steps first, then execute; completion doubles
>
> **s04** &nbsp; *"Break big tasks down; each subtask gets a clean context"* &mdash; subagents use independent messages[], keeping the main conversation clean
>
> **s05** &nbsp; *"Load knowledge when you need it, not upfront"* &mdash; inject via tool_result, not the system prompt
>
> **s06** &nbsp; *"Context will fill up; you need a way to make room"* &mdash; three-layer compression strategy for infinite sessions
>
> **s07** &nbsp; *"Break big goals into small tasks, order them, persist to disk"* &mdash; a file-based task graph with dependencies, laying the foundation for multi-agent collaboration
>
> **s08** &nbsp; *"Run slow operations in the background; the agent keeps thinking"* &mdash; daemon threads run commands, inject notifications on completion
>
> **s09** &nbsp; *"When the task is too big for one, delegate to teammates"* &mdash; persistent teammates + async mailboxes
>
> **s10** &nbsp; *"Teammates need shared communication rules"* &mdash; one request-response pattern drives all negotiation
>
> **s11** &nbsp; *"Teammates scan the board and claim tasks themselves"* &mdash; no need for the lead to assign each one
>
> **s12** &nbsp; *"Each works in its own directory, no interference"* &mdash; tasks manage goals, worktrees manage directories, bound by ID

## The Core Pattern

```python
def agent_loop(messages):
    while True:
        response = client.messages.create(
            model=MODEL, system=SYSTEM,
            messages=messages, tools=TOOLS,
        )
        messages.append({"role": "assistant",
                         "content": response.content})

        if response.stop_reason != "tool_use":
            return

        results = []
        for block in response.content:
            if block.type == "tool_use":
                output = TOOL_HANDLERS[block.name](**block.input)
                results.append({
                    "type": "tool_result",
                    "tool_use_id": block.id,
                    "content": output,
                })
        messages.append({"role": "user", "content": results})
```

Every session layers one mechanism on top of this loop -- without changing the loop itself.

## Scope (Important)

This repository is a 0->1 learning project for building a nano Claude Code-like agent.
It intentionally simplifies or omits several production mechanisms:

- Full event/hook buses (for example PreToolUse, SessionStart/End, ConfigChange).  
  s12 includes only a minimal append-only lifecycle event stream for teaching.
- Rule-based permission governance and trust workflows
- Session lifecycle controls (resume/fork) and advanced worktree lifecycle controls
- Full MCP runtime details (transport/OAuth/resource subscribe/polling)

Treat the team JSONL mailbox protocol in this repo as a teaching implementation, not a claim about any specific production internals.

## Quick Start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shareAI-lab/learn-claude-code
cd learn-claude-code
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # Edit .env with your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

python agents/s01_agent_loop.py       # Start here
python agents/s12_worktree_task_isolation.py  # Full progression endpoint
python agents/s_full.py               # Capstone: all mechanisms combined
```

### Web Platform

Interactive visualizations, step-through diagrams, source viewer, and documentation.

```sh
cd web && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

## What's Next -- from understanding to shipping

After the 12 sessions you understand how an agent works inside out. Two ways to put that knowledge to work:

### Kode Agent CLI -- Open-Source Coding Agent CLI

> `npm i -g @shareai-lab/kode`

Skill & LSP support, Windows-ready, pluggable with GLM / MiniMax / DeepSeek and other open models. Install and go.

GitHub: **[shareAI-lab/Kode-cli](https://github.com/shareAI-lab/Kode-cli)**

### Kode Agent SDK -- Embed Agent Capabilities in Your App

The official Claude Code Agent SDK communicates with a full CLI process under the hood -- each concurrent user means a separate terminal process. Kode SDK is a standalone library with no per-user process overhead, embeddable in backends, browser extensions, embedded devices, or any runtime.

GitHub: **[shareAI-lab/Kode-agent-sdk](https://github.com/shareAI-lab/Kode-agent-sdk)**

## Sister Repo: from *on-demand sessions* to *always-on assistant*

The agent this repo teaches is **use-and-discard** -- open a terminal, give it a task, close when done, next session starts blank. That is the Claude Code model.

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) proved another possibility: on top of the same agent core, two mechanisms turn the agent from "poke it to make it move" into "it wakes up every 30 seconds to look for work":

- **Heartbeat** -- every 30s the system sends the agent a message to check if there is anything to do. Nothing? Go back to sleep. Something? Act immediately.
- **Cron** -- the agent can schedule its own future tasks, executed automatically when the time comes.

Add multi-channel IM routing (WhatsApp / Telegram / Slack / Discord, 13+ platforms), persistent context memory, and a Soul personality system, and the agent goes from a disposable tool to an always-on personal AI assistant.

**[claw0](https://github.com/shareAI-lab/claw0)** is our companion teaching repo that deconstructs these mechanisms from scratch:

```
claw agent = agent core + heartbeat + cron + IM chat + memory + soul
```

```
learn-claude-code                   claw0
(agent runtime core:                (proactive always-on assistant:
 loop, tools, planning,              heartbeat, cron, IM channels,
 teams, worktree isolation)          memory, soul personality)
```
